Lifecycle Rules in TF:
=====================
create_before_destroy:-

lifecycle {
  create_before_destroy = true
}

prevent_destroy:-

lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy = true
}


ignore_changes:-

lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = [
    tags
 ]
}
     (OR)
lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = all
}

====================

terraform taint aws_instance.webserver.id
terraform untaint aws_instance.webserver.id

# Note: when you perform terraform taint, what will happen is that the specified instance would be marking as tainted. The next terraform apply time, it will be getting executed
and destroyed and provisioned a new instance. Most suitable situation is "provisioner time, if we put wrong command on inline section or script, where taint comes in picture".
